'''
This file contains the PSEUDOCODE for the entire robot operation.
Use the following notations in the code:
- All distances are in inches
- The distance sensors are called front_left_sensor, front_right_sensor,
  left_sensor, right_sensor, and back_sensor.
    - front_left_sensor() will read the sensor distance, etc.
- The drive train motors are called front_left_motor, front_right_motor,
  back_left_motor, and back_right_motor.
	- front_left_motor(spd) will spin the motor at speed spd, etc.
	- motors(spd1, spd2, spd3, spd4) runs the 4 motors together
- The lift mechanisms are called front_left and back_lift
    - front_lift(state) moves the front lift as far UP as it can go
      or as far DOWN as it can go, etc.
    - lifts(front_state, back_state) runs the 2 lift mechanisms SIMULTANEOUSLY
- Both vacuums are identified as vacuum
	- vacuum(state) can be ON or OFF
- signal EOP with buzz()
